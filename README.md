Road safety is a critical issue, and wearing helmets is a key factor in reducing injuries during accidents. However, monitoring helmet compliance among riders can be a challenging task. This project addresses the problem by combining advanced AI techniques to detect non-helmet riders and extract their license plate details automatically.

The solution uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) models, specifically YOLOv2 and YOLOv3, for object detection. YOLO is a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm known for its speed and accuracy in detecting multiple objects in real-time. The system first detects motorbike riders and identifies whether they are wearing helmets. If a rider is found without a helmet, the system proceeds to the next step—license plate extraction.

For this, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is applied to recognize the text on the detected license plate. OCR converts the text into a digital format, enabling automatic storage and further processing. The entire process, from detecting non-helmet riders to extracting license plate details, is efficient and highly accurate.

This project has practical applications in traffic surveillance systems. Authorities can use it to monitor traffic violations automatically and issue penalties without the need for manual intervention. It reduces the dependency on human resources and ensures a systematic approach to enforcing road safety regulations.

By leveraging cutting-edge technologies like YOLO and OCR, this project showcases how AI can contribute to societal well-being. It aligns with Cognizant’s vision of driving digital transformation and solving real-world challenges through innovative solutions. This system not only promotes compliance with traffic laws but also fosters a culture of safety, potentially saving countless lives on the road.
